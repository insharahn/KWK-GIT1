            <p>
              I am just another twenty-year-old living in Pakistan with her
              parents trying to make her way through life (and the Computer
              Science degree that's been hounding her for two years). I'm a
              full-time student, cat mom, and middle child, and a part-time
              programmer and reader.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the way, my name is pronounced insh-uh-ra, but I don't mind if
              you say it like insh-ra instead!
            </p>

        <h3>My Coding Journey</h3>
        <p>
          My coding journey actually began right here at
          <span class="darkpink-text">Kode With Klossy </span>
          two years ago during the summer of 2023 when I joined the Data Science
          Summer Camp as a Scholar. It was during a time that I was unsure of
          what degree to pursue for my undergraduate degree; I was torn between
          Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the time I spent as a Scholar helped me a lot as it offered
          me a glimpse into the expansive world of programming. That month I
          spent playing around with Python, SQL, and Looker Studio eventually
          led to me deciding to pursue Computer Science, and the rest, as they
          say, is history!
        </p>
        <div class="text-with-cplusplus">
          <p>
            As of today, I am fluent in C++, C, SQL, Assembly, HTML, CSS, and
            have dabbled in Python, C#, Javascript, Shell script, and more. I've
            built projects ranging from video game recreations to comprehensive
            databases with multiple interfaces. It's been a tough journey so
            far, but a rewarding one!
